Certainly! Let's break down the process you followed in the code and the model creation for wildfire image classification:

### 1. **Image Handling:**
You started by handling and cleaning the images:
- You used a custom class JPEG to check and remove any corrupted or incomplete images from your dataset. This ensures that only valid images are used in the model training process.
- check_images function goes through each image, decodes it, and removes bad images if they can't be properly decoded.

### 2. **Dataset Loading:**
You used the keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory function to load the dataset from the directories:
- **Training, Validation, and Test datasets**: You organized your dataset into directories like /train, /valid, and /test, with subfolders representing each class (wildfire and nowildfire).
- The function automatically assigns labels based on the folder structure, where wildfire and nowildfire will be assigned integer labels (0 and 1, respectively).
- Images are resized to 256x256 pixels, which is standard practice for deep learning models to ensure uniform input size.

### 3. **Data Normalization:**
You normalized the images by dividing their pixel values by 255.0 to scale them to the [0,1] range. This is a common preprocessing step to improve training efficiency and convergence during the optimization process.

python
def process(image,label):
    image = tf.cast(image/255. ,tf.float32)
    return image,label


### 4. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model:**
You designed a CNN for classifying wildfire images:
- **Conv2D**: You used 3 convolutional layers with increasing filter sizes (32, 64, and 128). These layers automatically learn important features (edges, textures, etc.) from the images.
- **BatchNormalization**: This layer helps in stabilizing and speeding up the training process by normalizing the activations of the previous layers.
- **MaxPooling2D**: This down-samples the spatial dimensions (height and width) of the feature maps, reducing the computational load and making the model more invariant to small translations of the image.
- **Flatten**: After the convolutional layers, the output is flattened into a 1D vector to be passed into fully connected layers.
- **Dense**: Fully connected layers, where the first dense layer has 128 neurons, followed by 64 neurons. These layers help the model learn non-linear combinations of the features.
- **Dropout**: Dropout layers (with 10% rate) are used to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 during training.
- **Final Output Layer**: A sigmoid activation is used in the final layer, as it's a binary classification problem (wildfire or not), so the output will be a probability between 0 and 1.

python
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3,3), padding='valid', activation='relu', input_shape=(256, 256, 3)))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2), strides=2, padding='valid'))
model.add(Conv2D(64, kernel_size=(3,3), padding='valid', activation='relu'))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2), strides=2, padding='valid'))
model.add(Conv2D(128, kernel_size=(3,3), padding='valid', activation='relu'))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2), strides=2, padding='valid'))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.1))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.1))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))


### 5. **Model Training:**
You compiled the model using the Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss (since it's a binary classification), and accuracy as the evaluation metric:
python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])


Then you trained the model for 10 epochs using the fit function, providing the training and validation datasets:
python
history = model.fit(train_ds, epochs=10, validation_data=validation_ds)

During the training, the model learned to classify wildfire and non-wildfire images based on the features learned from the convolutional layers.

### 6. **Results Visualization:**
You used Matplotlib to visualize the training and validation accuracy and loss curves:
- **Accuracy curves**: Show how well the model performed on both training and validation data over epochs.
- **Loss curves**: Track how the loss decreased over time, indicating how well the model optimized itself to improve predictions.

python
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], color='red', label='train')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], color='blue', label='validation')
plt.legend()
plt.show()


### 7. **Model Testing:**
You have also begun the process of testing the model with an image:
python
test_img = cv2.imread('/content/-59.03238,51.85132.jpg')

This is where you would load a test image, process it, and use the trained model to make predictions on it.

---

### Summary:
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensured no corrupted images are included.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Resized and normalized the images.
- **Model Architecture**: Designed a CNN with multiple convolutional layers, batch normalization, max pooling, dropout, and dense layers for classification.
- **Training**: Trained the model for 10 epochs and tracked the training and validation performance.
- **Evaluation**: Plotted accuracy and loss curves to assess model performance.

Now, you can further test the model on unseen data and potentially fine-tune it to improve performance if necessary. Would you like to continue with predictions, or would you prefer to explore further optimizations?

Here's a detailed explanation of the **code** for the **YouTube Transcribe Summarizer LLM App**:

### Code Breakdown:

```python
import streamlit as st
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()  ##load all the environment variables
import os
import google.generativeai as genai
from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi
```

- **Imports**:
  - **streamlit as st**: Streamlit is used to build the web appâ€™s interface. The `st` is an alias for the Streamlit library.
  - **dotenv**: This is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file to securely store API keys.
  - **google.generativeai as genai**: This imports the Google Gemini Pro API library (`genai`) which will be used to generate the summary.
  - **youtube_transcript_api**: This library is used to fetch the transcript of a YouTube video by its video ID.

```python
genai.configure(api_key=os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY"))
```
- **Google API Key Setup**:
  - `os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")` retrieves the API key from the environment variable `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. This key is used to authenticate the app when accessing Google Gemini Pro for generating content.
  - The `genai.configure()` method sets up the connection to the **Google Gemini Pro** API using the API key.

```python
prompt = """You are YouTube video summarizer. You will be taking the transcript text
and summarizing the entire video and providing the important summary in points
within 250 words. Please provide the summary of the text given here: """
```
- **Prompt for Summarization**:
  - This `prompt` is the instruction that will be sent to **Google Gemini Pro**. It defines the task the model is expected to perform.
  - The model is expected to take a transcript, summarize it, and provide the summary in bullet points within **250 words**.

```python
def extract_transcript_details(youtube_video_url):
    try:
        video_id = youtube_video_url.split("=")[1]
        
        transcript_text = YouTubeTranscriptApi.get_transcript(video_id)

        transcript = ""
        for i in transcript_text:
            transcript += " " + i["text"]

        return transcript
    except Exception as e:
        raise e
```
- **Function to Extract Transcript** (`extract_transcript_details`):
  - This function takes a YouTube video URL (`youtube_video_url`) as input and extracts the transcript.
  - **Steps**:
    - It splits the video URL (`youtube_video_url.split("=")[1]`) to extract the `video_id`, which is the part of the URL that uniquely identifies the video.
    - The **YouTubeTranscriptApi.get_transcript(video_id)** function is used to fetch the transcript for the video using the video ID.
    - The transcript is returned as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains a portion of text from the video. These parts of text are concatenated into a single string to form the full transcript.
    - If there is any issue (e.g., no transcript available for the video), an exception is raised, which can be caught to inform the user.

```python
def generate_gemini_content(transcript_text, prompt):
    model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-pro")
    response = model.generate_content(prompt + transcript_text)
    return response.text
```
- **Function to Generate Summary** (`generate_gemini_content`):
  - This function takes the full `transcript_text` and the pre-defined `prompt` as input.
  - It initializes the **Google Gemini Pro** model using `genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-pro")`.
  - The `model.generate_content()` function sends the `prompt + transcript_text` to **Gemini Pro** for content generation (summarization in this case). The model processes the input and returns a response with the generated summary.
  - The summary (response.text) is then returned by the function.

```python
st.title("YouTube Transcript to Detailed Notes Converter")
youtube_link = st.text_input("Enter YouTube Video Link:")
```
- **Streamlit Interface**:
  - `st.title()` sets the title of the web app.
  - `st.text_input()` creates a text input box in the app where users can enter a **YouTube video URL**. This allows users to provide the URL of the video they want to summarize.

```python
if youtube_link:
    video_id = youtube_link.split("=")[1]
    print(video_id)
    st.image(f"http://img.youtube.com/vi/{video_id}/0.jpg", use_column_width=True)
```
- **Video Thumbnail**:
  - If a `youtube_link` is entered, the `video_id` is extracted from the URL (`youtube_link.split("=")[1]`).
  - The thumbnail image for the YouTube video is displayed using the `st.image()` function. The image URL is constructed using `http://img.youtube.com/vi/{video_id}/0.jpg`, where `{video_id}` is the unique identifier for the video.
  - `use_column_width=True` ensures that the image is resized to fit the width of the column.

```python
if st.button("Get Detailed Notes"):
    transcript_text = extract_transcript_details(youtube_link)

    if transcript_text:
        summary = generate_gemini_content(transcript_text, prompt)
        st.markdown("## Detailed Notes:")
        st.write(summary)
```
- **Getting the Summary**:
  - When the **"Get Detailed Notes"** button is pressed, the app triggers the `extract_transcript_details()` function to fetch the transcript for the entered YouTube video.
  - If the transcript is successfully retrieved, it is passed to the `generate_gemini_content()` function, which generates the summary using **Google Gemini Pro**.
  - The summary is displayed in the **Streamlit app** using `st.markdown()` and `st.write()`. The `st.markdown()` is used to create the section header "Detailed Notes", and `st.write()` displays the generated summary text.

### Summary of Flow:
1. The user enters a **YouTube video URL** in the text input field.
2. The app extracts the `video_id` from the URL and displays the video's thumbnail.
3. When the user clicks **"Get Detailed Notes"**, the app fetches the transcript of the video using **YouTubeTranscriptApi**.
4. The transcript is sent to **Google Gemini Pro** for summarization.
5. The generated summary is displayed on the app.

### Key Concepts:
- **YouTubeTranscriptApi**: A Python library that fetches the transcript of a YouTube video if available.
- **Google Gemini Pro**: A generative language model (powered by Google) that can generate summaries based on given prompts.
- **Streamlit**: A Python library used to build interactive web applications, which is used here for creating the frontend interface.
- **dotenv**: A library to load environment variables (e.g., API keys) from a `.env` file to keep them secure.

### How it Works Together:
- **User Interaction**: The user interacts with the Streamlit interface by providing a YouTube link and clicking a button.
- **Backend Process**: The backend extracts the transcript, sends it to **Google Gemini Pro**, and receives the summary.
- **Frontend Display**: The summary is displayed back to the user in the form of **detailed notes**.

This app essentially makes it easy for users to get quick, concise summaries of YouTube videos without needing to read through the entire transcript.

### WhatsApp Chat Analyzer Project

This project analyzes WhatsApp chat data and provides various statistical insights, visualizations, and word analysis from a chat export file. It consists of three primary files:

1. **`app.py`**: Streamlit web app that provides the front end for uploading a WhatsApp chat file, selecting the user for analysis, and displaying different analyses.
2. **`helper.py`**: Contains helper functions for processing the chat data and generating statistics, word clouds, emoji analysis, and more.
3. **`preProcessor.py`**: Responsible for processing the raw chat data, extracting messages, dates, users, and other relevant information.

### Detailed Explanation:

#### 1. **`app.py`**:
This is the main file where the user interacts with the application.

- **File Upload**: 
  - The user uploads a WhatsApp chat file through a file uploader in the sidebar using `st.sidebar.file_uploader()`.
  - The uploaded file is then decoded to a string and passed to the `preProcess()` function in the `preProcessor` module for processing.

- **User Selection**:
  - The `user_list` is generated from the unique users in the chat, excluding `group_notification`. The user can select a specific user to analyze or choose "Overall" to see group-wide statistics.
  
- **Show Analysis Button**:
  - When the "Show Analysis" button is clicked, the program displays:
    - **Message statistics**: Total messages, words, media messages, and links shared using the `fetch_stats()` function.
    - **Timelines**: Monthly and daily message timelines using `monthly_timeline()` and `daily_timeline()` functions, visualized with `matplotlib`.
    - **Activity Maps**: Shows the most active days and months using bar plots, as well as weekly activity heatmaps.
    - **Word Cloud**: A word cloud visualization of the most used words in the chat.
    - **Common Words**: A bar chart showing the most common words (excluding stop words).
    - **Emoji Analysis**: Displays emojis used in the chat and their frequencies using the `emoji_helper()` function and `plotly`.

#### 2. **`helper.py`**:
This file contains the functions that process the data and generate various reports and visualizations.

- **`fetch_stats()`**: Returns statistics such as the total number of messages, total words, number of media messages, and number of links shared. It also handles filtering the data based on the selected user.
  
- **`most_busy_users()`**: Returns the top 5 most active users based on the message count and the percentage of total messages each user has sent.

- **`create_wordcloud()`**: Creates a word cloud by removing stop words and generating a visualization of the most frequently used words in the chat.

- **`most_common_words()`**: Returns the 20 most common words, excluding stop words, and displays them in a horizontal bar chart.

- **`emoji_helper()`**: Analyzes emoji usage in the chat and returns the count of each emoji used, displayed as a pie chart.

- **`monthly_timeline()`** and **`daily_timeline()`**: Generate time series data for message counts on a monthly and daily basis, respectively.

- **`week_activity_map()`** and **`month_activity_map()`**: Generate activity maps showing the most active days of the week and months of the year.

- **`activity_heatmap()`**: Creates a heatmap to show activity at different times of the day and days of the week.

#### 3. **`preProcessor.py`**:
This file handles preprocessing the raw WhatsApp chat data, extracting relevant details such as dates, times, users, and messages.

- **`preProcess()`**:
  - **Date Extraction**: Extracts the timestamp and message using regular expressions and splits them into separate lists.
  - **Message Parsing**: Separates the user and the message from the `user_message` column.
  - **Date Features**: Adds new columns for the date, year, month, day, and time-related information such as hour, minute, and period.
  - **Period Mapping**: Maps each message to a specific time period (e.g., `00-01`, `01-02`).

### Working Flow:

1. The user uploads a WhatsApp chat file.
2. The data is preprocessed to extract useful information (dates, users, messages).
3. The user selects either a specific user or "Overall" to analyze the chat.
4. Various analyses are shown:
   - Total messages, words, media messages, and links for the selected user.
   - Monthly and daily timelines of messages.
   - Activity maps to show the most active days and months.
   - Word cloud and common words to analyze the frequent words in the chat.
   - Emoji analysis to see the distribution of emojis used.
5. For group-wide analysis, the busiest users are shown, along with their contribution to the chat.

### Key Features:

- **User-specific analysis**: Users can select a particular person or view overall group statistics.
- **Timelines**: Visualizes trends over time to show when users are most active.
- **Activity maps**: Identifies the most active days and months for the selected user or group.
- **Text analysis**: Word cloud and most common words give insights into the chat's content.
- **Emoji analysis**: Shows which emojis are most commonly used in the conversation.

### Libraries Used:
- **Streamlit**: To build the web app.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Plotly**: For visualizations.
- **WordCloud**: For generating word clouds.
- **Seaborn**: For creating heatmaps.
- **Emoji**: For extracting emojis from text.
- **URLExtract**: For extracting URLs from messages.

### Potential Improvements:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Adding sentiment analysis to determine the tone of the messages.
- **Chat Group Comparison**: Comparing activity between different users in a group chat.
- **Topic Modeling**: Analyzing the topics being discussed in the chat using techniques like LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).

This project provides valuable insights into WhatsApp chat conversations, which can be useful for understanding communication patterns, identifying key moments, and analyzing the content of group chats.



The **WhatsApp Chat Analyzer** is a web-based application built using Streamlit, which allows users to upload their WhatsApp chat data (in `.txt` format) and analyze various aspects of the chat, such as message frequency, word cloud generation, emoji usage, and activity heatmaps.

Below, I explain the entire code step by step.

### 1. **`app.py` (Main Streamlit Application)**

```python
import streamlit as st
import preProcessor
import helper
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.express as px
import seaborn as sns

st.sidebar.title("Whatsapp Chat Analyzer")
```
- **`streamlit`**: Used for creating the web application interface.
- **`preProcessor`**: The script that processes the raw WhatsApp chat data into a structured DataFrame.
- **`helper`**: Contains functions that calculate statistics, generate visualizations, and assist in the analysis of the WhatsApp data.
- **`matplotlib`, `plotly.express`, `seaborn`**: Libraries for data visualization.

The app begins by setting a title on the sidebar.

### 2. **File Upload and Pre-processing**

```python
uploaded_file = st.sidebar.file_uploader("Choose a file")
if uploaded_file is not None:
    bytes_data = uploaded_file.getvalue()
    data = bytes_data.decode("utf-8")
    df = preProcessor.preProcess(data)
    st.dataframe(df)
```
- `st.sidebar.file_uploader`: A file uploader widget for users to upload a `.txt` WhatsApp chat file.
- If a file is uploaded, the file content is read and decoded into a string format. This string is passed to the `preProcess()` function from the `preProcessor.py` script to process and return a structured DataFrame `df`.

### 3. **User Selection for Analysis**

```python
user_list = df['user'].unique().tolist()
user_list.remove('group_notification')
user_list.sort()
user_list.insert(0, "Overall")

selected_user = st.sidebar.selectbox("Show analysis wrt", user_list)
```
- `df['user'].unique()`: Extracts the unique users from the DataFrame, removing group notifications (as they are not individual users).
- `st.sidebar.selectbox`: A dropdown widget that lets the user select a specific user for analysis. The `"Overall"` option includes data for the entire group.

### 4. **Displaying Basic Stats**

```python
if st.sidebar.button("Show Analysis"):
    num_messages, words, num_media_messages, num_links = helper.fetch_stats(selected_user, df)
    st.title("Top Statistics")
    col1, col2, col3, col4 = st.columns(4)

    with col1:
        st.header("Total Messages")
        st.title(num_messages)
    with col2:
        st.header("Total Words")
        st.title(words)
    with col3:
        st.header("Media Shared")
        st.title(num_media_messages)
    with col4:
        st.header("Links Shared")
        st.title(num_links)
```
- When the "Show Analysis" button is clicked, the application calls the `fetch_stats()` function from `helper.py` to calculate:
  - **Number of messages**
  - **Number of words**
  - **Number of media messages**
  - **Number of links shared**
- The results are displayed using the `st.columns()` function to lay them out in 4 columns.

### 5. **Displaying Time-based Analysis**

#### Monthly Timeline

```python
st.title("Monthly Timeline")
timeline = helper.monthly_timeline(selected_user, df)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(timeline['time'], timeline['message'], color='green')
plt.xticks(rotation='vertical')
st.pyplot(fig)
```
- **Monthly Timeline**: The `monthly_timeline()` function groups the data by month and year, counting the number of messages in each month.
- This data is plotted using `matplotlib` to show the number of messages over time, with vertical labels on the x-axis for better readability.

#### Daily Timeline

```python
st.title("Daily Timeline")
daily_timeline = helper.daily_timeline(selected_user, df)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(daily_timeline['only_date'], daily_timeline['message'], color='black')
plt.xticks(rotation='vertical')
st.pyplot(fig)
```
- **Daily Timeline**: Similar to the monthly timeline, this shows the number of messages sent on each specific day, using `daily_timeline()`.

### 6. **Activity Maps**

#### Most Busy Day

```python
st.title('Activity Map')
col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
with col1:
    st.header("Most busy day")
    busy_day = helper.week_activity_map(selected_user, df)
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.bar(busy_day.index, busy_day.values, color='purple')
    plt.xticks(rotation='vertical')
    st.pyplot(fig)
```
- **Most Busy Day**: The `week_activity_map()` function calculates the number of messages for each day of the week. A bar chart is plotted to show which day of the week had the most messages.

#### Most Busy Month

```python
with col2:
    st.header("Most busy month")
    busy_month = helper.month_activity_map(selected_user, df)
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.bar(busy_month.index, busy_month.values, color='orange')
    plt.xticks(rotation='vertical')
    st.pyplot(fig)
```
- **Most Busy Month**: Similar to the daily activity, but this shows the busiest month in terms of messages.

#### Weekly Activity Map

```python
st.title("Weekly Activity Map")
user_heatmap = helper.activity_heatmap(selected_user, df)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
ax = sns.heatmap(user_heatmap, annot=True, fmt='g', cmap='YlGnBu', cbar_kws={'label': 'Message Count'})
st.pyplot(fig)
```
- **Weekly Activity Heatmap**: The `activity_heatmap()` function creates a heatmap using `seaborn` to show message counts across the days of the week and periods of the day (morning, afternoon, etc.).

### 7. **Word Cloud and Common Words**

#### Word Cloud

```python
df_wc = helper.create_wordcloud(selected_user, df)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.imshow(df_wc)
st.pyplot(fig)
```
- **Word Cloud**: The `create_wordcloud()` function generates a word cloud to visualize the most frequently used words in the selected user's messages (excluding stop words).

#### Most Common Words

```python
most_common_df = helper.most_common_words(selected_user, df)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.barh(most_common_df[0], most_common_df[1])
plt.xticks(rotation='vertical')
st.title('Most commmon words')
st.pyplot(fig)
```
- **Most Common Words**: The `most_common_words()` function creates a bar chart showing the top 20 most frequent words used by the selected user.

### 8. **Emoji Analysis**

```python
emoji_df = helper.emoji_helper(selected_user, df)
st.title("Emoji Analysis")

col1, col2 = st.columns(2)

with col1:
    st.dataframe(emoji_df)

with col2:
    fig = px.pie(emoji_df.head(), values='Count', names='Emoji', title='Emoji Distribution')
    st.plotly_chart(fig)
```
- **Emoji Analysis**: The `emoji_helper()` function extracts and counts the emojis used by the selected user. The results are shown as a pie chart using `plotly`.

### 9. **Group-Level Analysis**

If the "Overall" user is selected, the app will show:
- **Most Busy Users**: Who contributed the most messages in the group.

```python
if selected_user == 'Overall':
    st.title('Most Busy Users')
    x, new_df = helper.most_busy_users(df)
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    col1, col2 = st.columns(2)

    with col1:
        ax.bar(x.index, x.values, color='red')
        plt.xticks(rotation='vertical')
        st.pyplot(fig)
    with col2:
        st.dataframe(new_df)
```
- **Most Busy Users**: The `most_busy_users()` function shows the top 5 users based on the number of messages sent.

---

### 10. **`helper.py` (Helper Functions)**

This script contains various functions that help with processing the chat data and generating the statistics and visualizations.

- **`fetch_stats()`**: Calculates the number of messages, words, media messages, and links shared by a selected user.
- **`most_busy_users()`**: Returns the users with the highest message count.
- **`create_wordcloud()`**: Generates a word cloud, excluding stop words.
- **`emoji_helper()`**: Analyzes the emojis used by the selected user.
- **`monthly_timeline()`, `daily_timeline()`, etc.**: Generate time-based visualizations like the number of messages sent per month/day.
  
---

### 11. **`preProcessor.py` (Data Preprocessing)**

This script is responsible for cleaning and structuring the raw WhatsApp chat data into a useful format for analysis.

- **`preProcess()`**: Processes the raw text data and creates a DataFrame with columns for the date, user, message, etc. It also converts the `message_date` into datetime format and extracts additional features like the day of the week, month, hour, and period (morning, afternoon, etc.).

---

In conclusion, the Whats
